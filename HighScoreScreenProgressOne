/* Create a Highscore screen that displays upon a loss of the game
 * Before game starts user will have put in their user name which will be a 3 letter combination of some sort
 * Upon loss of the game the highscore data base will appear on the screen that will be most likely stored on some sort of .txt file
 * Will Store top 10 highscores
 * Maybe have a method to restart the game
 * Concept looks like this:
 * 										User			Score
 * 
 * 										TOM				1050
 * 										ALX				450
 * 										MAD				356
 * 										HUH				250
 * 										PRE				45
 * 										MAX				44
 * 										JLL				35
 * 										FRD				26
 * 										GRD				20
 * 										CDE				15
